# ABC-MSM-Turing
Basic scripts doing Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) / Microsimulation models (MSM) using Turing.jl

* SingleParameter.jl is a very basic script that was used to get the basic things working
* ParameterVector.jl has two parameters, and allows exploring correctly and incorrectly calibrated ABC
* CheckCIs.jl goes more into the calibration issue, by Monte Carlo.
